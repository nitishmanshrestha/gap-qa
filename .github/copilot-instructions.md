# Stitch: project rules

Stitch brings together all the essentials needed for GAP candidates. It is a single-file tool (`view/gap-handim-tagger.html`) that helps QAs organize and showcase a year of achievements for the GAP interview. Each claim has an optional claim story, built from the artifact, problem, description and the scenario behind each competency it touches and, in its "utility belt", links, images and metrics for the detailed artifact. Created by Nitish Man Shrestha.

## Sources of truth

- Policy and competency facts: `knowledge/GAP-competency-matrix-knowledge-base.md`. Never invent policy. Check the tier lists in section 9 and Appendix E before touching competency or tier logic.
- `source-deck/` holds the original deck (`.pptx`) and its text export (`.md`). Read-only; do not edit.
- User data lives in the user's own JSON file (File System Access API). Never write real claims into this repo.

## Before writing code

1. Read the matching file in `.github/instructions/` (design system, app architecture).
2. Re-read the exact lines you will edit. The formatter rewraps lines, so stale context breaks replacements.
3. Reuse existing tokens, helpers and classes before adding new ones.

## Hard rules

- One self-contained HTML file. No build step, no scripts from CDNs. The only allowed external request is the Google Fonts stylesheet for Figtree and Newsreader in the page `<head>`; the UI must still look fine with the system fallbacks, and the exported deck never depends on it.
- Vanilla HTML, CSS and JS only. Target Edge and Chrome on Windows.
- Escape every user string with `esc()`. Rich text goes through `sanitizeHtml()`. Never put user text into `innerHTML` raw.
- Do not add dependencies, frameworks or an API key field.
- Keep the exported deck dependency-free: plain HTML, CSS and a small script, no CDN assets.
- Keep stored claim fields backward compatible. Add optional fields; never rename or remove existing ones.

## Working style

- Short, impersonal answers. No emojis. No markdown docs unless asked.
- Label any suggested filename as provisional.
- After editing, run `get_errors`, then verify in the browser (reload the page, exercise the feature, screenshot UI changes). Say plainly what was not verified.
- Do not delete files without asking; the folder is not a git repository.
